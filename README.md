# PepINVENT: Generative Peptide Design Beyond Natural Amino Acids
Updated by Anirudh Sridhar, Carleton University with fixed dependencies as of April 2025.
- Includes a validator.py file that automates workflow of using PepInvent. (WIP: Paused)
- notes.md contains all of my unorganised research notes pertaining to this tool. Might or might not be accurate info :)
- requirements.txt has conda env dependencies.
- tensorboard functionality was not tested.

Do look at the original PepInvent repo for more info: https://github.com/MolecularAI/PepINVENT
